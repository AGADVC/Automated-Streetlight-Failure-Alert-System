# Automated-Streetlight-Failure-Alert-System
This project uses an ESP32, LDR sensor, and GPS module to automatically detect streetlight failures. When continuous darkness is detected, the system verifies GPS coordinates and sends an email alert to authorities with the exact location. It improves maintenance efficiency and supports smart‑city monitoring.
